### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was launched when the client, DriverPass, approach us in order to design a system for their business. The system that DriverPass wanted was about providing student drivers with educational materials for driving lessons to pass exams and to be able to schedule appointments with instructors to practice driving. The system that DriverPass wanted had to be online as they wanted their customers to have access to it from any device with internet access. Addionally, it needed to offer different packages for their customers to purchase, each with its own education content and the ability to schedule driving pracice lessons with instructors.

### What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I did well in collecting requirements and investigating what the system needed to be both functional and to meet the needs to the client. I made sure to extensively cover all of the client's needs while keeping in mind the limitations of the system to make sure that everything could come together into a single system that would work.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part of my work that I would choose to revise it would be my diagrams. I believe that my diagrams could have been more detailed. There was a limitation with the number of boxes and lines that I could use when using LucidCharts and that made me have to only highlight a certain number of important features for my diagrams, and this meant that some features that I wanted to add could not be added. Revising my diagrams would mean that I could add more detail as to how my system would function, especially my sequence diagram and the activity diagrams.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing the script from the talk with the client and by understanding what the different users of the system are. Once I thought of the different users of the system, I began to list what each user is expecting the system to give them, for example a student is expecting the system to let them schedule appointments and an instructor is expecting the system to let them give students feedback. By listing what each user would expect from the system based on the interview with the client I then implemented in the UML class diagram what information and methods the users need. From here I considered all of the activities that each user would take and that is how I implemented it into my system design. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a system because the user needs a reason to use the system in the first place, and if their needs are not met, they would seek a different system and I would have failed at successfully designing a system for the client.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach for designing software is to consider what the software does, what the inputs are, and what the outputs are. From here I can consider what the different use cases for the software are going to be and how the system would look and function when put together. After creating a diagram of the software and the use cases, I would begin to code, and I would test the code after various milestones that I set up. In the future, the techniques and strategies that I would use to analyze and design a system are requirement gathering by surveying potential clients and users of any system that I would design. This would help me in figuring out what features I could implement in the system that I did not consider before.
